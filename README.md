# 🕓 start_day

**start_day** is the foundation of my personal task-master automation project. It’s designed to kick off daily routines, enforce strict scheduling rules, and eventually integrate voice feedback and notifications.

## 🚀 Features (current & planned)
- ⏰ Enforces a daily task cutoff time (e.g., no tasks after 21:00)
- 🐍 Built with Python for modular automation
- 🔊 Voice feedback integration (using pyttsx3 / eSpeak-ng)
- 📲 Telegram notifications for task updates (coming soon)

## 🧠 Why this exists
I wanted a lightweight, headless-friendly script to manage my day without distractions — something that could run quietly on a Pi and still keep me on track.
